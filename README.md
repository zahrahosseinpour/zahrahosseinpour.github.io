# HTML & CSS
In this assignment, you will create a personal website and **publish** it using GitHub pages.

## :foot: Steps
1. Add the HTML for the About page to the `index.html` file
1. Add the HTML for the Skills page to the `skills.html` file
1. Add the HTML for the Experience page to the `experience.html` file
1. Add the HTML for the Education page to the `education.html` file
1. Add the HTML for the Interests page to the `interests.html` file
1. Use Flexbox and other CSS properties and add them to the `style.css` file so that your pages look like these:

    `index.html`
    ![index-page](https://res.cloudinary.com/mkf/image/upload/v1674680283/ENSF-381/labs/flexbox/about_paafuq.png)

    `skills.html`
    ![skills-page](https://res.cloudinary.com/mkf/image/upload/v1674680283/ENSF-381/labs/flexbox/skills_kudlfj.png)

    `education.html`
    ![education-page](https://res.cloudinary.com/mkf/image/upload/v1674680283/ENSF-381/labs/flexbox/education_d9hixu.png)

    `experience.html`
    ![experience-page](https://res.cloudinary.com/mkf/image/upload/v1674680283/ENSF-381/labs/flexbox/experience_zjyrux.png)

    `interests.html`
    ![interests-page](https://res.cloudinary.com/mkf/image/upload/v1674680283/ENSF-381/labs/flexbox/interests_oa1rhh.png)

1. Change the content so that they represent you (your picture, your education, your experince, etc.)
1. Make sure all the links are working if applicable (for instance, you don't have to add a Pinterest page if you don't have one, but the link to your resume should work)
1. Make sure the website is responsive at least on Desktop and Tablet devices (use `@media` queries for this). Here's an example of how it should react to screen size changes:
    ![responsive](https://res.cloudinary.com/mkf/image/upload/v1674681793/ENSF-381/labs/flexbox/responsive-small_nakjwj.gif)

1. It doesn't matter what threshold you're using for the `@media` query (`800px`, `600px`, etc.)
1. Commit all the changes to the `main` branch and push to the remote repo (here)
1. Create a **public** repo under your **personal** GitHub account with this name: `<your-github-username-in-small-caps>.github.io`
1. Add the new repository as a remote: `git remote add personal <new-personal-github-repo-address>`
1. Push your changes to the `main` branch of the new repo: `git push personal main`
1. Open up a browser and go to `https://<your-github-username>.github.io`. You should be able to see the website (it takes a few minutes)
1. Add the address to your webpage to the [`PAGE-ADDRESS.md`](./PAGE-ADDRESS.md) file
1. Commit to the `main` branch and push to the remote repo (here)

### :page_with_curl: Notes
- Make sure you save what you had for the About page in the `index.html` page. That's the default page that the browser shows when someone visits your website
- Make sure you alter the data on the examples so that the website represents you, not Rick
- Don't use any CSS frameworks for this assignment. You need to write all the CSS yourself
- Use Flexbox for the layout
- Feel free to make minor changes, such as changing colors and font-sizes
- Feel free to add new elements, data, etc.
